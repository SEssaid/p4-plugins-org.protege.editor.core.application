Reseting the Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 preferences may fix some problems
that Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 has during initialization or when it tries to
display data.
<p>
Sometimes the Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 preferences become invalid or
corrupted and Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 is no longer able to start up or
display things correctly.  In particular, on some occasions the
default font get set to something that does not work or a particular
look and feel does not work correctly with
Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9. Reseting the preferences will put things such as
<ul>
<li> the way entities are rendered,</li>
<li> recent visited directories and files,</li>
<li> the default look and feel and</li>
<li> the default inferences that are shown when the reasoner is
      started</li>
</ul>
back to their initial default state.  Most of this state can be
quickly restored by going to the File->Preferences menu.
