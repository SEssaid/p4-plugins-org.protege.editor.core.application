There is a seemingly known bug with hudson where its svn plugin does
not retrieve svn:externals files.  I have made a test directory to see
if we can fix this and in the mean time we will do nightly copies of
plugin.xml and version.properties from trunk.

There is also a bug with the properties plugin that is in progress.
